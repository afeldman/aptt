"""Classification Loss.
-------------------
This module contains the classification loss class for computing training losses for classification tasks.

Example:
>>> import torch
>>> from aptt.loss import ClassificationLoss
>>> criterion = ClassificationLoss()
>>> preds = torch.randn(2, 10)
>>> batch = {"cls": torch.randint(0, 10, (2,))}
>>> loss, loss_items = criterion(preds, batch)
>>> loss
tensor(2.4175)
>>> loss_items
tensor(2.4175)

Attributes:
ClassificationLoss: The class for computing classification losses.

Methods:
__call__: Compute the classification loss between predictions and true labels.
